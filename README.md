## Getting Started

2. **Clone the forked repository** to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Xplore.git
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

3. **Navigate to the project directory**:

```bash
cd Xplore
```

4. **Create a new branch** for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Replace `your-feature-name` with a descriptive name for your feature or change.
<hr>
ðŸš¨ **Potential Issue:** If you encounter an error saying `fatal: not a git repository`, it means you're not in the correct directory. Navigate to the `Xplore` directory and try again.
<hr>
## Making Changes

5. Make your desired changes to the codebase using your favorite code editor.

6. **Stage your changes**:

```bash
git add .
```

This command stages all the changes you've made.

7. **Commit your changes** with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "Add feature xyz"
```

Replace `"Add feature xyz"` with a concise description of your changes.
<hr>
ðŸš¨ **Potential Issue:** If you encounter an error saying `nothing added to commit but untracked files present`, it means you have new files that haven't been staged. Run `git add .` again and then commit your changes.
<hr>
## Pushing Changes

8. **Push your changes** to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Replace `your-feature-name` with the name of your branch.
<hr>
ðŸš¨ **Potential Issue:** If you encounter an error saying `remote origin already exists`, you may need to set the upstream repository by running:
<hr>
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/SharanRP/Xplore.git
```

Then try pushing your changes again.
